          code, guiding us through every bug, loop, and algorithm with your
          wisdom. Your superpower isnâ€™t just your knowledge, but your ability to
          inspire and challenge us to be the best versions of ourselves. Thank you
          for being our hero in the classroom and beyond! Stay legendary, Code
          Crusader.
